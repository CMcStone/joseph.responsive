postcard, ok ;-)

Installation

Getting the theme
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Zip file
++++++++++

If you are an end user, you might enjoy installation via zip file import.

    1. Download a `zip file <https://github.com/simplesconsultoria/joseph.responsive/raw/master/joseph.responsive.zip>`_ 
        
    2. Import the theme from the Diazo theme control panel.

Buildout
++++++++++

If you are a developer, you might enjoy installing it via buildout.

Add ``joseph.responsive`` to your ``plone.recipe.zope2instance`` section's *eggs* parameter e.g.::

    [instance]
    eggs =
        Plone
        ...
        joseph.responsive

Or, you can add it as a dependency on your own product *setup.py*::

    install_requires=[
        ...
        'joseph.responsive',
    ],


Enabling the theme
